## Overview of project
We as a group decided to look at Video Games sales over a long period of time to determine if game reviews are a significant factor when it comes to the success of a game. We selected this topic because we thought it would be an interesting subject to look into considering that the video game industry is worth over $200 billion dollars. For this analysis we are using two unique datasets. One of the datasets contains the sales numbers for many games dating as far back at 1975 covering the regions of North America, Europe, Japan, outside of the former regions, and a final global total. The second dataset contains the critic score and user score for thousands of video games. We hope to answer the question on if ctitic scores have any impact on sales figures.

## Communication protocols
- For our group project, we elected to create a slack group chat to post updates on progress for the project.
- We also use the slack huddle for small 2-person talks if needed, and we are using google meets for general team meetings.

## Description of the EDA
During the EDA, we found out that there was many repeating video game titles due to the same game being sold on multiple platforms. We also found an outlier with Wii sports as it was bundled in with the original wii which significantly inflated the total sales figure. Lastly we noticed that many small titles didnt have anyone to review those games which resulted in many nan values for reviews.
